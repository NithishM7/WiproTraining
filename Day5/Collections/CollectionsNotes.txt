Disadvantages of using Arrays in C#:

1. array size is fixed
2. we can store similar type of elements
3. as we know the array size is fixed so, if we allocate more memory then it will go waste even if there is no replacement
if we allocate less memory that it will create a problem.
4) We cannot insert an element into the middle of an array.
4) Searching based linear approach and if we have a large list

Collections - It represents the group of objects

Collections gives an advantage over an Arrays

1) It is dynamic in nature
2) group of records / objects for which we are treating it as a one single unit

They are the part of System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic namespaces

Non-generic type of collections:

ArrayList -- which is a resizable array(Stores object)
HashTable -- key-Value pair, unordered
Stack -- LIFO structure
Queue -- FIFO structure

List 1 = new ArrayList();
disadvantage -- No Type safety and no of timme it requires

Generic type of collections
List<T> Daynamic array of a specific type(Integer, String)
Dictionary<K,V> - storing the key-value storage
HashSet<T> No duplicate allowed
Queue<T> FIFO
Stack<T> LIFO
